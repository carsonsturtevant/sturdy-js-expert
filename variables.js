// variables

// let and const for declaration
let name = "John";
const value = 30;

// const wont let you use the = operator more than once
const value2 = 30;
value2 = 40; // this wont work

// can default to always using const and then changing
// to let if needed. const can work like a pseudo type checker

// dont use var anymore
var bad = "dont use this";

// let and const are block-scoped
